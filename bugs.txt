Bugs List
#1: collision detection for left wall is within the wall. WHY?!?!
2 days now and cant figure it out....
Solution: Take into account ball motion. If it's hitting the left wall, it's going negative in position.... calculate the negative for the collision, not the positive!

#2: height is not being detected up top at all, and its messing up the collision detection for the paddle. Unsure why.
Solution: With the top, it was similar to the left wall error. Required calculating negative from the motion. Bottom, works fine now too. No paddle collision issues at all.

#3: Unable to transfer boolean across classes without going through issues.
Solution?:Move ball randomizer to the ball class..... or a long annoying process of transfering numbers and selecting from there.

#4: Likely a syntax error. Unable to directly minus positioning through methods. Must figure out how to do this. Big requirement, both ball and paddle.
Solution: use getter and operator and math within setter.

#5: If connected right, the ball can enter the paddle from either side of the paddle, glide through it, and exit the other side. This causes a massive score increase. I'll do what most game developers do nowadays with bugs and just call it a feature.
